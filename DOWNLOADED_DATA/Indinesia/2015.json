    "Dozens of Indonesians are killed by respiratory illness and accidents due to poor visibility caused by severe haze. The haze occurs annually during dry season and is largely caused by illegal agricultural fires due to slash-and-burn practices in Indonesia, especially from the provinces of South Sumatra and Riau in Indonesia&apos;s Sumatra island, and Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo. The haze also hit neighboring Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei."
