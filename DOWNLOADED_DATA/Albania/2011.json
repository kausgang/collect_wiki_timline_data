    "The Central Election Commission begins burning the ballots of the 2009 parliamentary elections, in a routine process leading to the 8 May local elections, making a second count (repeatedly requested by opposition) impossible. The Socialist Party has accused the CEC and the Berisha government to attempt hiding vote manipulation.",
    "Economy and Trade Minister Ilir Meta resigns after being involved in a corruption scandal.",
    "Clashes break out between police and protesters in an anti-government rally in front of the Government building in Tirana. Three people are shot dead. The EU issues a statement to Albanian politicians, warning both sides to refrain from violence.",
    "Local elections see the victory of the Socialist Party of Albania (PS) in the main cities outside Tirana, Lezha and Scutari; The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe released a mixed evaluation of the electoral process, which was considered &quot;competitive and transparent, but took place in an environment of high polarization and mistrust&quot;. In Tirana, the match was between Edi Rama, incumbent mayor and PS leader, and Lulzim Basha, DP minister of the interior. After a long process of votes counting, Rama was first declared winner for a tight margin of 10 votes. Then, the DP-led Central Electoral Commission decided to add to the count some of the votes misplaced in the wrong boxes, a move on doubtful legal grounds that was contested by the opposition as well as by the OSCE. Basha was finally declared winner for 83 votes. The EU Commission president Jos&#xE9; Manuel Barroso consequently cancelled his visit to Tirana; the Nobel-prize Ismail Kadar&#xE9; pledged him to withdraw his candidacy to avoid the &quot;collapse&quot; and &quot;isolation&quot; of Albania."
