    "Greek Cypriots demanding Enosis, the union with Greece, instigated their first serious riots. The government-house in Nicosia was burned down; martial law was declared afterwards and the legislative council was abolished. The Greek National Anthem and the display of the Greek flag were banned. The British invented the terms \"Greek Cypriot\" and \"Turkish Cypriot\" and used the latter against the \"Greek Cypriots\" so as to cease Enosis demands."
