    "Bhutan and Nepal reach an agreement regarding the repatriation of certain classes of Bhutanese refugees living in camps in Nepal, subject to joint government verification. Points of contention included that some camp inhabitants were never citizens &#x2013; or some even residents &#x2013; of Bhutan before attaining refugee status. Also, the Bhutanese government regarded many political groups among the Nepalese Lhotshampa community, such as the Bhutan Peoples&apos; Party (BPP) and Bhutan National Democratic Party (BNDP), as terrorist or anti-national groups."
