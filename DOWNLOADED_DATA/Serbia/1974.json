    "A new federal <i>Constitution</i> awards greater powers to individual republics and provinces, shifting it into a voluntary confederation with a right of self-determination for each of the subjects. The Serbian Provinces of Kosovo and Metohija and Vojvodina are <i>de facto</i> separated from Serbia, as they were awarded state-treatment in the Federal Parliament, where they could veto any Serbian decision."
