    "Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa gives royal city rights to Novi Sad, the biggest Serbian settlement in this Empire, following the capitulation of Habsburg Serbia. The city becomes known as <i>Serbian Athens</i> and a place of Serbian national revival. Most of Serbian culture, including its patriarchy (Metropolitanate of Karlovci), is now &quot;in exile&quot; across the Danube and Sava rivers overlooking Ottoman Serbia to the south. More Serbian cities are granted a <i>Free Royal Status</i> in years to come chiefly by Maria Theresa of Austria: Sombor, Be&#x10D;kerek, Subotica (<i>Maria-Theresiopolis</i>), etc."
