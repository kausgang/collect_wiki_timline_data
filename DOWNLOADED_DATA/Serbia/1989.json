    "Slobodan Milo&#x161;evi&#x107; delivers his <i>Gazimestan Speech</i> in front of 1,000,000 Serbs at the central celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo. He calls for a &quot;full equality among peoples of Yugoslavia&quot;, demanding an end to the &quot;dramatic ethnic and political divisions&quot;. This was basically a message to both his political (democratic) and nationalist (Croat, Bosniak) opponents. His popularity skyrockets among nationalist Serbs, leading to his victory in the elections for the <i>Serbian president</i> a few months later."
