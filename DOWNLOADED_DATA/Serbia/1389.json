    "According to myth Milo&#x161; Obili&#x107; establishes the <i>Order of the Dragon of St George</i>, an alliance of Serb aristocracy against the Ottoman invaders. Out of 12 knights only 1 survives the battle passing his credentials to Stefan Lazarevi&#x107; and various European <i>draconists</i> (knights of Austria, Naples, Kingdom of Hungary, Spain, etc.)",
    "A 40,000 strong Serbian army led by Prince Lazar Hrebeljanovi&#x107; of Rascia, Vlatko Vukovi&#x107; of Bosnia, Milo&#x161; Obili&#x107; and most other prominent nobles faced the better equipped and trained Ottoman army in the Battle of Kosovo. Casualties on both sides were extremely high &#x2013; both leaders died in the battle (Serbian Lazar Hrebeljanovi&#x107; and Ottoman sultan Murad I) and most of the Serbian aristocracy became extinct. Most of the Empire was now in Ottoman hands save for the Serbian Despotate, Montenegro and Bosnia which soon followed."
