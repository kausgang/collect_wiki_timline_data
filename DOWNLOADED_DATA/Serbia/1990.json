    "The League of Communists of Yugoslavia dissolves along ethnic lines, as Slovene and Croatian representatives storm out of the Congress after opposing the strengthening of the Union. The first free elections are held several months later in Croatia (Croatian parliamentary election, 1990) and Slovenia, where separatist options have prevailed overwhelmingly.",
    "The Parliament of Croatia ratifies a new <i>Constitution</i>, declaring the indigenous Serbs of Croatia (12.2%) a <i>national minority</i> rather than a <i>constituent nation</i>. Serbs have enjoyed that autonomy <i>de facto</i> since the <i>Croat-Hungarian Ausgleich</i> in the 19th century. Franjo Tu&#x111;man, leader of the Croatian Democratic Union, publicly denies the Serbian Genocide and the extent of the Holocaust, spreading fear among minority Croatian Serbs as he assumes power as the president of Croatia.",
    "Serb-populated regions of Croatia organize a poll on their self-rule within Croatia. The <i>Log Revolution</i> is also launched in the hinterland of Dalmatia, the Serbian city of Knin, blocking Croatian roads and splitting the country into two parts. The <i>National Council of the Croatian Serbs</i>, led by Milan Babi&#x107;, declares \"the autonomy of the Serbian people on ethnic and historic territories on which they live and which are within the current boundaries of the Republic of Croatia as a federal unit of the SFR Yugoslavia\" in form of Kninska Krajina.",
    "The <i>Slovenian independence referendum</i> passes with an 88% support. Independence would have been declared within the succeeding 6 months"
