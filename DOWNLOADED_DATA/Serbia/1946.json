    "the <i>National Committee for the War Crimes and Reparations</i> concludes that 1,7 million people have died during World War II in Yugoslavia, many of whom were victims of civil war and the Croatian racial policy. Serbs account for about 65% of the total victim count, or 1,2 million people. About one third of the numbers are the victims of the Jasenovac concentration camp, according to this research. These numbers are a matter of controversy today but, nevertheless, reflect a high level of human losses in the country during World War II."
