    "The YNLA liberates the Jasenovac concentration camp, following a retreat of Nazi and Usta&#x161;e forces. 50,000 prisoners who were able to walk were freed and led from the camp. Massive destruction of data preceded the liberation, making it hard to determine the extent of the <i>Serbian Genocide</i>. The numbers reach several hundred thousand victims.",
    "Aided by the Soviet army, Yugoslav Partisans expel fascist and Nazi forces from the country, ultimately defeating the royalists as well. Usta&#x161;e flee the country as well, among whom also Ante Paveli&#x107;, Petar Brzica, etc. Yugoslav Danube Swabians are also forced to leave the country, as well as many Hungarians and Italians.",
    "Federal People&apos;s Yugoslavia or <i>Second Yugoslavia</i> is proclaimed by the Yugoslav Federal Parliament in Belgrade. The monarchy is officially abolished and the royal family banned from entering the country.",
    "Serbian lands are dismantled under a pretext of Serbian hegemony and self-determination, being given to republic of Montenegro, provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, republic of Macedonia, republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, even to republic of Croatia (Baranja region), leaving Serbia, in form of Serbia proper, crippled in territory and population despite its Allied-orientation. Territories of Croatia are expanded into Baranja, Dalmatia and Istria under Croatian dictator Josip Broz Tito, despite the role of Croatia in the war (<i>ethnic balance policy</i>)."
