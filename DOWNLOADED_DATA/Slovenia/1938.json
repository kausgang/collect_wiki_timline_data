    "Some members of TIGR plan an attempt on Italian Fascist leader Benito Mussolini&apos;s life, when he visits Kobarid.",
    "Adolf Hitler annexes Austria to the Nazi Germany. Slovenes in Austrian Carinthia practically become German citizens.",
    "Dragi&#x161;a Cvetkovi&#x107; becomes prime minister. He signs an agreement with the leader of Croatian opposition Vladko Ma&#x10D;ek allowing for the foundation of the Banovina of Croatia as the sole autonomous political and territorial unit in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
