    "State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs breaks off all relations with Austria-Hungary and proclaims a short-lived State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. Slovenia joins a new state with an independent State authority. The state is not recognized internationally.",

    "The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs joins with the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Montenegro to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (SHS). Today it is believed that this was a great historical fault although at that time this was probably the only sensible decision because Italy according to the London Pact with the victorious Entente forces from 1915 without bias occupied Primorska, Istria (<i>Istra</i>) and Zadar in Dalmatia and Serbia was pressing for unification."
