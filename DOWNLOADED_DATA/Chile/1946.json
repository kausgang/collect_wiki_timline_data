    "Gabriel Gonz&#xE1;lez Videla becomes president, backed by a broad alliance of parties, including the Radicals and Communists. Once in power, he accedes to pressure from the United States and promulgates the Law of Permanent Defense of the Democracy, also known as the <i>Ley Maldita</i> (\"accursed law\").
